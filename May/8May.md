## DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.28.610198v2.full
### Journal: Bioarchive

#### Introduction

1. Tried to understand how de-novo genes incorprate to already existing system.
2. Previous literature have indicated that it's easier for hydrophobic motifs to arise as compared to hydrophilic motifs.
3. In yeast it's been observed that Beneficial denovo proteins contains majorly transmembrane domains.
3. Model organism: Yeast.

#### Question
1. Interaction of BEP during early stage of transition of b/w noncoding $\rightarrow$ coding gene

#### Results

1. BEP contains C terminal transmembrane domains 
2. BEP are highly susceptible to degradtion at ER.
3. These denovo proteins are localized in ER and moved to membrane via three major pathways.
    * Guided entry of tail anchored proteins (GET)
    * Srp-inDependent (SND)
    * ER associated degradation pathway (ERAD) *controls homeostatsis*
    * ER secretory pathway for reaching to vacuole.
4. These BEP are cell membrane specific not internal organelle membrane specific.
5. C terminal is responsible for ER targeting and localization.

#### Key Finding

1. Beneficial de-novo genes localized near endoplasmic reticulum sites.
2. Majority of them contains C terminal transmembrane domain with low level of sequence similarity.
